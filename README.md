# WOW_Yellowteeth
Code for the WoW' Children's Museum Teeth Exhibit

The Exhibit is a mouth with teeth. The teeth are painted with yellow heat sensative paint. When the teeth are heated the paint turns white. We have a vibration sensor mounted on the back of the teeth. We also have 5 heaters and two tempature sensors. The heaters keep the teeth at a maintance tempature just below the point where the color will change. When the vibration sensor see's that someone is brushing the teeth, the heaters heat up the teeth to just above the color change point.
