The MOSFET's are on the Right. The green terminals are on the left.

1st Terminal - Heater One
2nd Terminal - Heater Four
3rd Terminal - Heater Three
4th Terminal - Heater Five
5th Terminal - Heater Two

6th Terminal - Vibration Sensor

7th Terminal - Tempature Sensor Power
8th Terminal - Tempature Sensor Ground
9th Terminal - Tempature Sensor Data lines
	Top - Right Tempature Sensor
	Bottom - Left Tempature Sensor
	
Notes:
	The following heaters are interchangable: 1&4, 3&5
	The Tempature Sensor Data lines ARE NOT interchangeable. Getting them wrong will quickly lead to one heater running away until the temp values diverge enough to hit the fail safe.
